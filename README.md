Problem Solving Case

## Problem Statement

Bookmyshow is a ticketing platform where you can book tickets for a movie show. The image attached represents that for a given theatre we can see the next 7 dates. As one chooses the date, we get list of all shows running in that theatre along with the show timings.

P1 - As part of this assignment, we need to list down all the entities, their attributes and the table structures for the scenario mentioned in the previous slide. You also need to write the SQL queries required to create these tables along with few sample entries. Ensure the tables follow 1NF, 2NF, 3NF and BCNF rules.
